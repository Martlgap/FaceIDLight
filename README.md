## üìò Description
A lightweight face-recognition toolbox and pipeline based on tensorflow-lite with MTCNN-Face-Detection 
and ArcFace-Face-Recognition. No need to install complete tensorflow, tflite-runtime is enough. All tools are
using CPU only.

Pull request are welcome!


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features 
- Online Face-Recognition
- Running completely on CPU
- Multi Faces
- ~4 FPS on a MacBookPro2015
- Tools for Face-Detection, -Verification and Identification


## ‚úÖ ToDos
- [ ] GPU support
- [ ] Resolution-dependent model-selection
- [ ] Multithreading for multiple faces
- [ ] Fix bug installing with setup.py (not finding external url for tflite-runtime)
- [x] OpenCV Window freezes on MacOS when quitting (seemed to be fixed)


## ü•£ Requirements
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
- [TensorflowLite-Runtime 2.5.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to install the FaceIDLight as a package
Simply install the package via pip from git:
```zsh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/martlgap/FaceIDLight
``` 
or if you do not have git installed on your system, install it directly from the wheel:
```zsh
pip3 install https://github.com/Martlgap/FaceIDLight/releases/download/v.0.1/FaceIDLight-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
``` 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use the FaceIDLight as Repo
Clone the repository, init a virtual environment and install the requirements:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Martlgap/FaceIDLight.git
cd FaceIDLight
python3.8 -m venv venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to install tflite-runtime
If you have troubles to install tflite-runtime:

You can easily install tflite-runtime from https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ with the following line:
```zsh
pip3 install tflite-runtime==2.5.0 --find-links https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime
```

## üöÄ Run Demo:
Run Python 3.8 and type in:
```python
from FaceIDLight.demo import Demonstrator
Demonstrator().run()
```
You can select your own directory for gallery-images (*.png and *.jpg images are supported) by simply add 
a keyword argument to the Demonstrator Class: `Demonstrator(gal_dir=<full-path-to-your-gallery>)`

You might change the webcam address ID. Do so via selecting a certain number for stream id:
`Demonstrator(stream_id=<-1, 0, 1, 2, ...>)`

Test the face-identification by simply holding a foto into camera. The provided sample_gallery includes images 
from: (Andrew_Caldecott, Anja_Paerson, Choi_Sung-hong, Elizabeth_Schumacher, 
Eva_Amurri, Jim_OBrien, Raul_Ibanez, Rubens_Barrichello, Takahiro_Mori)

Press "q" to close the Demo. (Window has to be selected)
